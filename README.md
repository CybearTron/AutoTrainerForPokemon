# AutoTrainerForPokemon
My AutoTrainer for pokemon (tested in desmume in black nuzlocke)


SO In a blog https://cybeartron.hashnode.dev/making-an-auto-training-bot-for-pokemon-black-with-python I worked on an autotrainer for pokemon black and then I also did some work myself later...

So this is the code and the file you can change it according to your will!!!

Defaults:
/ for pressing any random arrow keys 3 times with x as default for running which can be changed in the code
, for pressing z at some intervals for training and the z can be changed in the code 

CATCH EM ALL!!!
